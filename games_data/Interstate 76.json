It's 1976 - a different '76
Stretched out before you are thousands of miles of desert - the American Southwest
The massive engine roars as you slam down the accelerator
It's time to get funked up
You are Groove Champion, auto-vigilante
Your agenda: Payback for your dead sister
Your weapon: A 425-horsepower '72 Picard Piranha with two 50-caliber M60 machine guns on top and a flame-thrower on the side
You're one mean dude in an even meaner ride
They've messed with the wrong Champion.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War Anthology is the ultimate collectors edition, featuring the original Dawn of War, its two expansion packs - Winter Assault and Dark Crusade - and more.

Dawn of War:
Ten thousand years have passed since the treasonous acts of Chaos toppled the Golden Age of mankind
Fires burn brightly throughout the galaxies, illuminating carnage and slaughter as mankind defends itself from ancient enemies
Hardened forces collide with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of their opposition
Control one of four unique races in head-to-head or cooperative multiplayer action, where faith, skill, and strategy are requisites in ruling the universes.

Winter Assault:
The expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game
Lost amongst the ruins of a leveled city lies an Emperor Class Titan, a war vessel of untold power forged in the planet-wide furnaces of Mars, and revered by billions as the epitome of Imperial dominance
The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world
The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance.

Dark Crusade:
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade will feature two new playable races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons, bringing the number of totally unique races to an unprecedented seven
In addition to the two new playable races, Dark Crusade will feature an all-new single player campaign centering on the conquest of a "meta-map," with each territory captured giving tangible rewards to the occupying force
A greatly expanded multiplayer component and a completely unique economy model for the Necrons will present gamers with the most compelling Dawn of War game to-date.

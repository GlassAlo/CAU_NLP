Tasty Blue is an underwater side-scrolling eat 'em up game
You start as a small goldfish with an insatiable appetite
After being overfed by your owner, you'll escape into the ocean and eat everything that you encounter
The more you eat, the bigger you get!
In addition to the goldfish, you'll also play as a dolphin and a shark
The dolphin starts off as an overworked aquarium star, forced to jump through flaming hoops for food
He escapes from captivity by eating his way through the aquarium and taking revenge on his trainer
The shark is the final playable character, an artificial fish created by scientists to save Earth's oceans
It uses self-replicating nano technology to consume everything in its path and convert their matter into its own
There's no telling how big this shark will get.
There are over 50 levels in the main story mode of the game
There are also 15 more challenging bonus levels to play after the main game has been completed.

For countless generations there was very little to stand between vampires and their human prey--until now
In Blade II, you are a vampire hunter who possesses all the strengths of a vampire, and none of its weaknesses
Skilled in martial arts, guns, and swordplay, you must protect humans from the hungering darkness
Keep the evil forces at bay with your 360-degree combat system and unstoppable rage powers
High-tech weaponry, destructive rage abilities, and over-the-top finishing moves turn every enemy encounter into an action-packed bloodbath.

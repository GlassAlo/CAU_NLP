After New York, what city could be screwy enough for a CRAZY TAXI game? You guessed it, an amped-up version of Las Vegas serves as the backdrop for this chapter in this ultra-tense driving game
As with previous series installments, the object of the game is to collect as much fare money as possible by picking up and delivering passengers at record speeds
You'll have to create a few shortcuts of your won in order to win, and that will mean causing a few crashes and knocking down a few buildings.

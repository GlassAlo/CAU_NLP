Antioch is an online cooperative interactive fiction game.

Based on a story written by FibreTigre (the award winning author of Out There), you’ll play as one of two detectives working together to solve a intriguing crime
The adventure will bring you to the city of Antioch, a dark metropolis surrounded by moutains and sea.

We love text adventure games, and we wanted to approach them differently
We really believe that multiplayer will breath new life to this genre, giving more depth to your choices, because you’re playing with another human being.

Antioch could be summarized as a multiplayer gamebook, playable on all mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and Apple watch).

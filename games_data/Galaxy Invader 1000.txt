Fire Away was a series of handheld electronic games marketed by Tandy beginning in the 1980s
In all, there were six different products in the line, nearly all of which were actually licensed by Tandy rather than being original Tandy games
The games looked to capitalize on the popularity of the video game Space Invaders which was released in 1978.

Darkmere: The Nightmare's Begun is an action-adventure game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design in 1994.

Viewed isometrically, Darkmere sets you as Ebryn, the son of the former King of Darkmere, a barren cursed land, with the aim of discovering what happened
The area is besieged by problems, including orcs running riot, and racial tension between different species.

It is Zero Hour's only title to date
Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32.

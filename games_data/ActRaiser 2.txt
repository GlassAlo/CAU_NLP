ActRaiser 2 is a side-scrolling platform game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Quintet and published by Enix in 1993.

The game is a sequel to the original ActRaiser, but the storyline is not directly connected to its predecessor; however, many plot details suggest that ActRaiser 2 may actually be set before the events of the original ActRaiser, or takes place in another universe entirely
Otherwise, the given story draws concepts from the famous religious epics Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy.

Unlike the original game, which alternately combined platform game sequences and god game sequences, ActRaiser 2 is only a platform game.

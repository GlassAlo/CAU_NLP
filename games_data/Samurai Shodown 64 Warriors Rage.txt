Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage is a 3D fighting game produced by SNK for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system It's the sixth game in Samurai Shodown series and the eighth in the official chronology (tenth if considered the non-canonical games)
It is the followup to the original Samurai Shodown 64 on the same platform, and like its predecessor, it received relatively no distribution outside of Japan
It should not be confused with Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage, which is an entirely different game
In order to avoid confusion, some sources refer this game as Samurai Shodown 64 II.

Panting, scared, the shelter airlock smashes down behind you
You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do
It would be easier to give up
But you don’t
The hardship, the hunger, the thirst
The fear
You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive
Why you do this
Then you hear it
“Daddy, you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies
You need not tell her how you got them
You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times
In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube…

Sheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”
Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.

With all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you’ll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying
Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter
You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your family’s survival for just one more day.

Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is the first natively developed for the Wii console
Unlike the other games focused on free exploration, this title is an on-rails shooting game with fixed movement and perspectives
While playing, the camera floats to different areas and players shoot enemies on the screen, picking up ammo, weapons and health kits in the progress
In some situations, the controller can also be used as a melee weapon or in timed sequences
Some levels feature multiple paths and there are regular checkpoints
At the end of a level, the player's performance is awarded by stars, which can be exchanged for weapon upgrades
The game supports the Wii Zapper and features cooperative gameplay for up to two players.

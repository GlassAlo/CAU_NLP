Verzerk is a hack of Berzerk, adding speech this time around, with a robotic voice welcoming the player during the attract mode, then states "this is Verzerk"
The phrases from the original arcade version of "shoot him", "chicken, fight like a robot", "got you humanoid", etc
are included in this release
The game plays identically to Berzerk though, aside from that and only being for one player.

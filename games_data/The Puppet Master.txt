Deadly rotating blades
Bottomless ditches of death
And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate times gunning for your death
As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned psycho-lunatic lady
Thankfully, you are otherwise granted the ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you
Survival in the game demands meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions
Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back
It's a game of control or be controlled.

Lock-On is a 1986 first-person combat flight simulator video game with a futuristic theme
It was developed by Tatsumi and licensed to Data East for US distribution
Its graphics feature scaling sprites and a full-screen rotation effect
The game consists of 20 levels
Gameplay is similar to After Burner: the plane follows a predefined path, but the player can steer it slightly to evade incoming missiles
The player can fire guns and homing missiles, the latter of which requires the eponymous lock-on first.

Fray is a gritty sci-fi game set in 2098, a world where civil society is on the brink of collapse
Three mega-corporations vie for control of the Earth and its remaining resources
In a world where most human interaction is confined to cyberspace, mankind has created a variety of virtual reality modules in which to escape the harsh realities of life and experience the full range of human emotions once known by generations past
Some modules are created for human enjoyment while others have been created to serve more devious purposes
One of the most pivotal virtual environments is the combat module, Fray.

Resident Evil Code: Veronica is the fourth video game in Capcom's Resident Evil survival horror series
The game continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles
However, it is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement
Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles showing protagonists, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.

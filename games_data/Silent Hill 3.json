Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill series
Like the previous entries, Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror combining action-based combat and puzzle-solving, but is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding installments
The main character is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.

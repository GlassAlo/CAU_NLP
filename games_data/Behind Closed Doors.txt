A totally light-hearted romp, featuring the mighty BALROG, who is trapped in the
'smallest' room
Together you must find a way of escape and perhaps wreak
revenge upon those responsible for this dastardly act
All you and the BALROG
have at your disposal are a copy of the 'Goblin Gazzette', the stub of a pencil
and your wits ...
will it be enough or will the poor BALROG be destined to
spend the rest of his days with nothing but cold porcelain for comfort? It might
not be easy but it will sure be fun!!

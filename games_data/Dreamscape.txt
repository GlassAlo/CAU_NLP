Just a normal day
Erin was quite happy how things were, studying biology and off to see her boyfriend
He, however, was about to change everything.

Her boyfriend, Terry, wants her to just watch him as he listens to a tune
He says it will be a special experience
She says he should stop joking but since he insists she gives him what he wants
After all, it's only wasting a few seconds of time.

Terry puts his headphones on
The next moment - the bedroom no longer exists
Erin has entered another world
She can only call out as she sees Terry across a bridge from where she is standing just moving away from her
Further and further away
Then, she is alone with nothing around her.

What has happened? Will Erin pierce the secret of Dreamscape? And will she ever find Terry again?

How do you balance -- and indeed encourage -- a war between factions without letting either side obliterate the other? How do you rule over gods, creatures, and men who refuse to obey you? How do you build a landscape of villages when bandits and mythology are conspiring to tear it down? Skyward Collapse places you into the role of The Creator, and frees you to tackle these problems your own way
Brought to you by the developer of the modern strategy classic AI War: Fleet Command, Arcen's second full strategy title is equally unique (but far easier to learn): a turn-based 4x strategic god-game

 
Your task is to build and populate the floating continent of Luminith
You create -- but cannot control -- gods, creatures, and artifacts from both Greek and Norse mythology
The power you wield with these is immense: Heimdall's horn causes everyone outdoors to drop dead, for crying out loud
Your task is to keep both factions alive and fighting until The Master calls you home -- but this is harder than it sounds
Bandit Keeps pop up periodically, as do Woes such as floods, serial killers, guild strikes, and vegetarian uprisings
Every game plays out differently, and you'll need even the craziest of your powers in order to survive what lies in store for you.

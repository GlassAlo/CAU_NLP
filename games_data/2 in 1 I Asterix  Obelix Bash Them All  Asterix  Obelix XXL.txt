One old, namely a port of the SNES game Asterix and Obelix
The other game is called Asterix & Cleopatra, based on the comic and animated movie of the same name

You play typical platform levels where you jump around obstacles and walk towards the right of the screen.
Astérix & Obélix XXL on the Game Boy Advance features the same story as its console/PC counterpart, but presents the 3D platformer gameplay in new and different levels rendered in an engine tailored to the handheld platform
To free the citizens of their village from Roman capture and prevent the formula of the magic potion from falling into Roman hands, Asterix and Obelix must make their way through six Roman provinces, each consisting of five or more levels.

A storm comes in and causes the gate at a ranch to open, letting horses and foals run away
Barbie must track down the foals and horses through 3 parts of 3 different settings: the forest, the mountains, and the beach
There is an average of three foals plus one horse that can be found at the end of the section
In the 2nd part of the section, a missing horse will be found by someone else, and Barbie must race them.

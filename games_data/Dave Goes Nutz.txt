Why does he have to pick on Dave’s little brother, Delbert, so much? Not only does he snatch the already kidnapping-prone Delbert, but he hides him away deep in the bowel of an insane asylum! Crazy nurses wearing purple of all colors wander the halls, cleaver wielding orderlies, and jolts of electricity all stand in Dangerous Dave’s way in Dave Goez Nutz!

Darkspore was a video game that borrowed creature editing technology from Spore
It was described as "a fast-paced, science fiction action-role-playing game in which the player battled across alien worlds to save the galaxy from the mutated forces of Darkspore"
In addition to the creature editor, the game featured a unique squad-based mechanic, various multiplayer options, and a player versus player arena
The game was released in North America on April 26, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, and in Europe on April 28, 2011.
EA seemingly has removed the store page of Darkspore from Steam, meaning any attempt to purchase it through Steam cannot be made
The game was later relisted with EA saying that they would continue to support for the game
Those who have purchased it prior to the page's removal still have the game and could play it until the servers were shut down permanently on March 1, 2016
The game is currently unplayable due to its DRM scheme requiring a connection.

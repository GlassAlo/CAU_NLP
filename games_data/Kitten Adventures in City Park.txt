It's hard to be a kitten if you have such a clumsy owner! Yesterday she lost a lot of things in the park and now it's up to you to find them! 
Memories of that day can be helpful – you should remember where have you seen that thing last and search there
And finally you can climb up a tree and ask a big cat for a hint – you will see all the events of that day again.

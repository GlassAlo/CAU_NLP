In September 2006, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, featuring new scenes and gameplay elements
Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the "Sanctuary" theme song instead of "Passion"
New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.

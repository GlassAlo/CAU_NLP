Our hero, a former Red Army captain, demoted during prewar repressions, finds himself on the frontline
Outnumbered and outgunned by the superior German forces, his battalion was destroyed and his few surviving friends were captured.

Fighting his way through occupied territory, our hero will liberate his comrades, reveal the mysteries of a secret weapon and foil the enemyâ€™s plans.

The storyline brings the hero into contact with NPCs that will help him survive: weapons vendors, allies that will fight on his side and peaceful civilians who provide quests or supply information.

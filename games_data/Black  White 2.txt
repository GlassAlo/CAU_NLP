In the game, the player takes the role of a god called from the void (nothingness) to help those who invoked them
However, the player is not an omnipotent style god, but rather a god who rises and falls with his believers and the player must help develop their nature according to their good or evil desires
The player also has a creature, their physical representation in the world, which takes the form of an anthropomorphic ape, lion, wolf, turtle, cow, or tiger
Its physical manifestation can grow to an immense size, and adopt a good or evil persona separate of the player's
They develop their character as the player rewards or punishes their actions
In addition to the god simulation and city-building elements introduced in the original Black & White, Black & White 2 also features elements of real-time strategy gameplay, with the addition of controllable warfare and fighting units.

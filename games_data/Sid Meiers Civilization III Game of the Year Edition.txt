Sid Meier's Civilization III is patched up and repackaged with extras in this "Game of the Year" reincarnation.

In addition to the original 4X conquer-the-world classic, new features include several new maps, a keyboard command reference card, a behind-the-scenes "making of" documentary, and an excerpt from the official strategy guide.

So you think you understand your device? Think again
Stop tapping
Stop swiping
In fact, stop touching the screen at all
To crack Blackbox’s puzzles you’ll need to find solitude and stillness, climb mountains, call on friends, get in tune with the cosmos, and think outside the box
Solutions that can’t be found beneath the glass of your screen redefine what a puzzle can be
You’ll never see your device the same way again.

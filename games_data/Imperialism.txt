In Imperialism you rule one of the Great Powers in a world modeled on the real world of the nineteenth century
As the game begins, your country and the other Great Powers begin a period of rapid economic, military, and social advancement due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution
You must first harness these historic forces to develop your own country, and then use your new found wealth and resources to compete successfully with the other Great Powers in the realms of diplomacy, trade, and war
Only one Great Power can establish the pre-eminent Empire in the world.

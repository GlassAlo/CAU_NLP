Visibility is a platformer with a unique twist
It is completely dark


That is until you place your lights, of course
Each level has a limited set of lights which you must strategically place around the level in order to illuminate your path to the exit
The challenge isn't over once you've got your lights in the right place, however
The platforming itself is a different challenge of its own, offering awkward jumps and varying traps that you will not be able to navigate safely if you have not lit up the level correctly


As there are no specific light locations, each one of the 20 levels have their own unique solution that you will create as you play
If you're not particularly efficient with your lighting then you may be forced to run through a section of a level completely unaided with only hope (or your memory) to save you.

[Unfinished 1984]

The last two agents we sent on this mission didn't come back
You're the only one we have left for the job
Mr
Andreas Skarfos, alias 'Scarfinger',has seized an island and set up a fortress there
He has a number of missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to any part of the globe, and unless we answer his demands, he will destroy us
His installations are all but invulnerable to surface attack, but we've discovered a tunnel which leads under the island
If one man could somehow reach the tunnel, they could stop Scarfinger!

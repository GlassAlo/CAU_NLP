In this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate a robot boy named Pino
You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion
Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him
He will also pick objects and make his own "experiments" with them
Your goal is to train Pino in various disciplines
His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on
By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.

The game features animations by Anime studios Mint and Omnibus Promotions
With direction from Takashi Yoneda and late anime director Umanosuke Iida.

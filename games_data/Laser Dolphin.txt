The Prime Minister has been abducted by aliens and there is only one mammal who can save him: Laser Dolphin.
Blast your way through 4 planets and 50 levels of underwater fun! Saving the Prime Minister won't be a simple task - there are many bizarre sea creatures that will try to stop you including Missile Fish, Robo Birds, TNT Turtles, Electric Eels, and Robo Sharks.
Fortunately you'll have a bit of help along the way
You'll get power-ups such as torpedoes, gold dolphins, machine guns, and the deadly laser sword (Laser Dolphin's favorite).
In addition to the main story mode, there are also 10 stunt levels and 10 race levels
With Game Center support, you can compete with your friends for the fastest times and best dolphin tricks.

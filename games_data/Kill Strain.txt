Kill Strain is a top-down, competitive twin-stick action shooter with a monumental twist where three teams are pitted against each other for domination
Featuring innovative 5v5v2 gameplay, two teams of five players battle to contain-and-control a mysterious and powerful energy source codenamed ‘The Strain’ that has been discovered in research facilities
The humans are not alone in these remote locations, as two additional players take on the roles of mutants
Endowed with additional abilities when in contact with ‘TheStrain’, the mutant team wreaks havoc on the humans to spread ‘The Strain’ further on the field; turning humans into mutants along the way and creating a more powerful force.

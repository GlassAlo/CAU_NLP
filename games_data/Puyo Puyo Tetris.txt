The game has tons of different styles of gameplay â€“ from the single-player Adventure and Challenge modes to the ferocious competition of the up-to-four player Arcade modes
There's plenty of Tetris/Puyo variety, even an in-game Shop where players can unlock new characters, new skins for Puyos and Tetriminos, new backgrounds and more."

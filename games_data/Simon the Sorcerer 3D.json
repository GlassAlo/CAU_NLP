Simon is back and this time in 3 dimensions!

The adventure begins with Simon's soul being reunited with his body on the roof of an Aztec Temple
Slightly confused and disoriented, Simon escapes the temple with the help of his new fairy godmother.

Once again explore with Simon a vast fantastical world and help him find a way back home by uncovering the secrets of 'The Nexus'
Do this before your arch nemesis, Sordid, can use its power for more evil means.

Meet up with favorite characters once more such as The Swampling, Calypso and the Woodworm! Enjoy over 40 hours of gameplay filled with ribald jokes, sly humour and 'off the cuff' quips.

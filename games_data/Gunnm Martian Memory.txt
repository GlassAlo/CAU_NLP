The winds blow the smell of oil and iron around an artificial creation, a city where people dwell between scrap and machine
In this town human beings and cyborgs live mixed-in together
Within there lives a "mostly cyborg, tuning and maintenance" cyberne doctor named Ido.

One day, he came out of the town and in a mountain of scrap found a cyborg girl asleep for hundreds of years and brought her back to life.

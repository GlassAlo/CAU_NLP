DND is the seminal mainframe classic, which started computer role-playing games
The name of the game clearly comes from the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) pen and paper role playing systems, and it uses D&D rules
Further inspired by Pedit5, the game itself is a classic dungeon crawl
It could be counted as a "rogue-like" but doesn't have random dungeons.

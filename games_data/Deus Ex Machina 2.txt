The legendary video game is reborn, Deus Ex Machina 2 is a darkly comic cradle-to-grave roller-coaster of your entire life
A surreal journey from before your birth, through the temptations and dangers of your life, and beyond your own death.

With complete rock album soundtrack and the greatest voice on the planet as your narrator - Christopher Lee
Imagine if your life was nothing more than some electronic game.

Imagine if you knew then what you know now
Imagine if you could replay your little life all over again
Battle your way to the womb and get born, then focus, crawl, stand, balance, run, jump, learn and obey!

Discover pleasure, love, pain, guilt and betrayal
Mess around, run away, hide out, suffer under, heal up, sell off, struggle through, knuckle down, tip over, cave in, dance on! Exploit your power, peddle your guilt, bust your body, embrace your decline, swallow your pills, lose your mind, dream your dreams and fly!

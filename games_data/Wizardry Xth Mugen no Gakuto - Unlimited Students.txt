Wizardry Xth: Unlimited Students is a dungeon crawling JRPG that uses a turn-based combat system with a team of 6 characters you can customize, from 10 races with 15 professions, during the game.

Sequel to "Wizardry Xth: Academy of Frontier", this game improves on the team compatibility system and changes the crafting process.

The game was only released in Japan.

A near identical game was released by a different company for the PSP, in Japan only, called "Class of Heroes" that reuses most of the source code of this game
It has a large number of surface changes but also has the same dungeon layouts and items as this game.

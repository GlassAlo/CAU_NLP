El Hijo is a spaghetti western, indie stealth game.
The game is set in a mythical place of the 19th century that very much resembles the American west, as we know it from Sergio Leoneâ€˜s westerns, taking some of its most popular characteristics of outlaw gangs, saloons, cunning, sarcasm, irony, etc
There is no indication of a specific time, or place
It could be everywhere and anywhere.

You guide 6-year old boy El Hijo on his quest to find his father, by escaping a monastery, fighting his way through the desert and avoiding monstrous creatures, and outsmarting horrible gangsters in the saloon of a villain town.

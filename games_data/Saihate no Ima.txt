This game tells the story of seven long-time friends
How they grew closer or further apart as they got older
The story is presented using a blog-like interface

 
The protagonist, Atemiya Shinobu, who was raised at a certain facility since young, had no one around him that could be called "friend"
Being that way, the first thing he started doing after leaving the facility with his sister - Chidori - was to find and make friends

 
Benio Azusa, a tomboyish girl who lived nearby

 
Hondou Sayaka, a quiet yet sharp-tongued girl who was in charge of raising the pets at school just like him

 
Tsukamoto Youko and Itsuki, a pair of siblings who belong to a prestigious family around the area

 
Higuchi Shouji, a boy he knew by being attracted to by the similarities they both share

 
Izuki Fueko, a girl he met by chance

 
Together with Shinobu, they were a group of seven
Just like that, each and every one of them, who had never experienced the joy of having friends, was able to meet each other and become companions
The story begins in a quiet town colored by dusk
Around the seven friends, there were understanding, empathy, conflict, and what's more, fleeting love of adolescence
It was a friendship that could last forever

 
Such a simple happiness should have..
lasted forever

 
That was until the "enemy" appeared

 
The "enemy" had disturbed the peaceful relationship of the seven people

Shinobu could not forgive that
He could not forgive the one that injures his companions, nor could he forgive the one that hurts another one's hearts
And when he realized all that, the world they reside in changed, rather then becoming the new world that it should have..
they had arrived at the "sanctuary" instead

 
This is a story that describes the heart

 
A story that describes the thing located in the farthest end of a heart.

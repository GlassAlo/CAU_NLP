Pescatore is a puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and meant to be published by Sunsoft
It was cancelled, but was briefly revealed to the public in spring of 1991 at Nintendo's Shoshinkai Show
The gameplay in Pescatore borrows the gameplay from PuyoPuyo and changes the rules slightly to require less skill and more luck.

Requital is a 2006 action RPG developed by Akella and Primal Software and released by Excalibur Publishing on the Microsoft Windows platform
According to the developers, part of the motivation in making Requital was to create an authentic 6th century Russian world for the player to explore
As such, the game veers away from anachronisms and modern fantastical elements like magic and mythological creatures
Instead, it is more centered on historical realism mixed with superstitions that existed in that period of Russian history.

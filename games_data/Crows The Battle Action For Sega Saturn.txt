Crows: The Battle Action is a beat-'em-up for the Sega Saturn
It is a 2D beat-'em-up based on the Crows manga series, where characters have super-deformed heads.
Published by Athena Co., it appears at first glance heavily inspired by Technos ' own hot-blooded Kunio/Nekketsu beat-'em-ups, going for River City Ransom 's fighting style and super-deformed looks in particular
As it turns out, it's no coincidence; a look at the credits reveals that quite a few former Technos employees worked on it, including executive producer Teruo Ishikawa, the composers, and about half the graphics team
Most notably, the person in charge of the visuals was Kouji Ogata.

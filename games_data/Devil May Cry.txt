Originally intended to be the fourth installment in the Resident Evil series, Devil May Cry is an action-adventure game that introduced a host of new elements to the gaming community
Chief among them is the Stylish Rank, which grades the player's performance in combat
The game is split into Missions, which are individually scored according to various factors, such as Orbs gathered and damage taken
Additionally, Devil May Cry did away with the pre-rendered backgrounds of prior Resident Evil games in order to allow for a dynamic camera system.

Congratulations!

You have been selected as Innomus' next Virtual Network Defense Contractor (VNDC)! You have been chosen because you are a talented go-getter, ready to explore the next generation of block-chain computing technologies, n0d3!

Each n0d3 is a fully procedural and enclosed environment derived from the periodic table of elements
Animon builders will generate a full set of procedural items and weapons for you each time you enter a new n0d3
If you require assistance, feel free to summon another Contractor for aid! Though, be warned that this feature gives Contractors the chance to invade you as well!

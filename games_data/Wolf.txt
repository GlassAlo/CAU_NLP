Wolf is a life simulator
You take the role of a wolf and live you life in the forests of North America, performing duties that real life wolves share, such as hunting, raising pups, and defending your territory
There are several maps to choose from, and many environmental and game play settings are customization, in a sandbox-like fashion
There are no ultimate goals, it is open world and you may do as you please.

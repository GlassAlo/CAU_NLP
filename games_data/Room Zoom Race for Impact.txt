In the twisted Room Zoom manor, you must use everything under the roof to hone your driving skills and take the checkered flag
Room Zoom puts you in the driver's seat of toy cars to race through every room in the house, including a spooky lab and a hidden tomb, both online and offline
In each room you'll find objects to push, bump, or blow up; power-ups to defend against aggressive drivers; and secret passages
Eight interactive environments, with unrestricted driving areas and hidden features, make each race an adventure.

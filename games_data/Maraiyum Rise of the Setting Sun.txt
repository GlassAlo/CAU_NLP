The coup has finally come!  
 
After the disastrous rule of the previous Emperor, the Imperial army have placed you, a distant relative with no training, on the throne
With rebellions, religious insurgency, widespread famine, and a rapidly dwindling treasury, time is not on your side
Over the course of one year you must decide how best to spend your time, training your skills to enable you to make the right decisions to restore the once great Empire of the Setting Sun to its former glory, or condemn it and you to the dustbin of history.

Alone with your jetpack, you have flown from Finland across the Urals and the entire length of Asia to deliver a package to Genoq Biolabs in Singapore
You land on the building`s 80th floor setback, finding nobody there to greet you
When you enter the building, the main door snaps shut behind you, and you narrowly escape being killed by the building`s security system.

You find the receptionist hiding behind her desk
She tells you that Genoq`s head scientist, Derrida, has been demanding the package you`re carrying
His last panicked message came over an hour ago
This package is more important than you could have thought.
You realize that there is only one course of action, that you `must` bring the package to Derrida, and, if at all possible, rescue any survivors you find along the way.

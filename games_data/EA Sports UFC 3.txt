In G.O.A.T
Career Mode, players must build fight hype to gain fans, earn cash to train at new gyms, and create heated rivalries with other fighters to capture the world's attention

In addition, an all-new suite of customizable multiplayer modes let you and your friends get into the Octagon and face off in fast, fun, intense pick-up-and-play bouts where a highlight-reel knockout is always only one strike away and victory happens in the blink of an eye.

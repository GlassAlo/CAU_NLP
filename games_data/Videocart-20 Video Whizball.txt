Video Whizball is a game where players control paddles that have to protect a goal from being entered by whizballs
To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward
Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction
If one of the missiles or whizballs hits the player's or the opponent's paddle, it will temporarily disappear leaving the respective goal undefended
The game is won when either one of the players gets to a previously selected score.

Imagine shooting pool with both players going for the balls at the same time
That's just a hint of the slam-bang action you'll find as you try to knock the whizballs into your opponent's goal.

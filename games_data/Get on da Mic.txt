Get On Da Mic requires the use of the same kinds of microphones also used with the Karaoke Revolution games
A hand-held karaoke microphone made by Logitech is available in a bundle with the game and is also sold separately; Logitech also sells a microphone headset
The game is also EyeToy compatible, and it censors out profanity.
Unlike the many other singing games available for the PlayStation 2, this game focuses exclusively on Hip-Hop songs.

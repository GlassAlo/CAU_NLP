Cutie Q is is the third and final game in the Gee Bee trilogy.

The player controls a set of paddles with a rotary knob, the objective being to score as many points possible by deflecting a ball against blocks, ghosts, spinners and other objects on the playfield.

Cutie Q is described as Namco's first "character game", thanks to its use of colorful and cute character designs, a choice that would be a major influence on Toru Iwatani's next project, Pac-Man.

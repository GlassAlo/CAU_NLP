EA's renamed basketball simulation set for an October 2010 release was cancelled at the last minute due to concerns over quality
The game was intended to introduce brand new control concepts and mechanics meant to innovate on the simulation basketball genre.

Developers of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions aimed to completely change the game's control system but were pressed for time with an 18-month development cycle
A demo released during development was plagued with glitches that were much publicized, including one YouTube video of player Andrew Bynum stuck in the middle of the court in the model's bind pose.
Copies of the PlayStation 3 version that entered circulation are considered rare collector's items.

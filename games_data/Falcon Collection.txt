From the very beginning the Falcon series has been acclaimed for its realism, pushing back the limits of what was thought possible for a computer flight simulator back in the day

 
It is as simple as that: the flight models are real, the terrain is real, the radar and weapon systems are real… And the threats are real
No phony weapons or magic bullets here… just the best civilian F-16 simulation available
You don’t just play Falcon, you strap yourself in and get ready for battle.

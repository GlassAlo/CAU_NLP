    "storyline": "The game has very little in way of a storyline, aside from the addition of Al Unser Jr. as a playable character, or as a couch. The season comprises a fairly typical formula one season. Al Unser Jr. was a prominent American race car driver who has won the Indianapolis 500 twice. Interestingly, he never raced in Formula One.",
    "summary": "Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing is a racing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System console released in 1990. It is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese-market Famicom game World Grand Prix - Pole to Finish, with the most notable changes being the addition of Unser as an in-game coach, the number of laps, sound and interface design. This game features a season mode and two time trial modes.",

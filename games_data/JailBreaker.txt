Set in a grim totalitarian futuristic society,a rather physically well-endowed red-headed female thief named Shlla is captured by the guards and put in prison.
The gameplay mostly consists of exploring the prison and its surroundings, picking up clues, talking to characters to gain information, etc
There are no real puzzles in the game; most of the time it is just necessary to initiate certain conversations to trigger events or pick up specific items for later usage
There are also some action-based segments in the game, including a few combat sequences, situations which require quick movement, and timed events.

Welcome to Tractor Farmer

Take your new tractor on a drive around your farm
As the farmer you must get your work done to make sure the farm keeps running


Use your driving skills to drive around the farm in your tractor doing tasks such as: 

- Collecting bales of hay 
- Planting seeds 
- Delivering goods with your trailer 
- Rescuing chickens 

All this takes place in a lovely 3D sunny environment
Suitable for kids (and adults) of all ages!

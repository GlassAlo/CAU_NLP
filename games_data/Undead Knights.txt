Playing as the anti-hero, you rage through the wrath of fearless enemies and build the nastiest and most profane army you can think of in this new-style invasion action game
Prepare to wash the mouth of your army with soap as they can't help but engage in zombie bashing dialog over a raging metal soundtrack that helps your channel your inner anger
If you can deal with the gut-wrenching, Smack-talking, fluid-spitting, and limb amputating ways of your army, you can embark on your journey of vengeance to defeat the king.

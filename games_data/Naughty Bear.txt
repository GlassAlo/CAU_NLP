In Naughty Bear, players take on the role of Naughty Bear, a bear driven to seek vengeance after the other bears don't invite him to the big birthday party
Scorned for the last time, Naughty Bear becomes hell bent on manipulating and terrorizing the blissful bears inhabiting the Island of Perfection.

As Naughty Bear, players will wreak havoc on every stuffing-filled foe that crosses their path
Featuring an array of weapons, objects and scare tactics, gamers strive to earn Naughty Points as they inflict physical and psychological harm on Naughty Bear's enemies
This all-new scare-based points system means players will win the most rewards for being deviant and maniacal
The variety allows for a completely new experience every time players pick up a controller and the ill-fated bears become more difficult to harass and terrorize as the game progresses.

Naughty Bear features more than 30 levels to unlock, with unique characteristics and weaponry encountered at every stage
Gamers can search the game world and collect all the hidden party items locked away by the other bears.

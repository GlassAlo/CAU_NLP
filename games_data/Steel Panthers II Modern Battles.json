Steel Panthers 2 - Modern Battles is the sequel to original Steel Panthers
This game however covers the battles of the latter half of the 20th century
You can experience the Korean War in the early 1950s, Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, and also several hypothetical late-1990s scenarios
The major improvements in the strategy over the Steel Panthers are the missile-armed units, refined mobility, and the ability of a unit to look in almost any direction instead of straight at a hex side, movable artillery, and helicopters.

Within the park, the game's thirteen main characters are held captive by a mysterious mechanical doll named "Alice", who holds the "death games", which basically force the characters against each other for survival - the losers being exiled back out into the world
Alice refuses to stop the games until only two characters are alive and present
The game's protagonist is Kaname Ichijou, a young man who has the ability to see sound as colors and sees spoken falsehoods in the color red
He also harbors a grudge against most of the rest of the characters of the game for allowing the exile of his little sister.

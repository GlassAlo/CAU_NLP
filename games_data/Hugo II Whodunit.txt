Hugo 2 is a much longer and far more difficult adventure game than the original title
Much of the game play is based in the huge cottage, though other areas include a stroll through a giant hedge maze, a journey through dangerous fields filled with snakes and bees, as well as travelling to a mysterious planet in a phone booth
Overall, this is a very enjoyable addition to the series which has the same fun and interesting atmosphere as the original.

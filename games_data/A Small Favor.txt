In a distant alien galaxy, where currency has been replaced with trade and favors, guide an assassin on a small favor to eliminate a prominent Senator.

Some game notes:
-Your decisions matter, your rank is dependent on the choices you make throughout the game.
-Favor collection is completely optional
-If you complete favors without being asked, you're a really good Samaritan
Unfortunately you won't get credit for them.

A Kickstarter for a PC/Mac version was launched, but unsuccessful in 2013.

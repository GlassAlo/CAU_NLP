Kurt Hectic in his snazzy suit with ribbon chute is back to save the universe
This time he is teamed with the genius Dr
Hawkins and the 6-legged gun-toting robotic dog, Max
Together they must out-sneak, out-blast and out-think their enemies as they attempt to reclaim the Earth from a vile alien menace.

All three characters - Kurt, Doctor Hawkins and Max are playable, each has his own levels, powers and items and a completely different gameplay focus
Kurt is about stealth and sniping, the Doctor has a few direct attacks but also has the ability to create items and effects out of simple household objects, while Max is a cigar smoking, quad gun toting demolition squad of a dog.

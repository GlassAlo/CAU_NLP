Langrisser IV was only released in Japan and is similar to its predecessors with the exception of a new turn system in the original Saturn version and a new movement system that was added for the Playstation version
For those of you unfamiliar with this series, it is a turn-based strategy RPG which involves placing you in story-based scenarios (battles) with victory and defeat conditions
(e.g
Victory - kill all enemies, Defeat - death of the main character).

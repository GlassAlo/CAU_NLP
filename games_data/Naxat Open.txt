Naxat Open is a golf simulator from Naxat Soft
Naxat Soft hired contract developers TOSE to develop the game
Released the same week as Power Golf, Naxat Open aimed for the more serious simulation crowd whereas Power Golf appealed more to those looking for a more casual golfing video game experience.

Besides a harsher level of challenge - the acceptable window of error is greatly diminished - Naxat Open plays much like other golf sims for console games: the gameplay chiefly focuses on hitting a power gauge just right to maximize the effect of each swing.

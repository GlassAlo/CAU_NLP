Perfect for the novice, yet sophisticated enough for the veteran, Starion Tactics is a casual, turn-based 4X space strategy game that delivers a deeply tactical and highly visual experience with fun and quick gameplay.

After assuming command of one of four human or alien factions vying for galactic dominance, immediately define your game’s scope
Play for minutes to hours across tens to hundreds of planets in single-player skirmish or multiplayer modes—it’s entirely up to you.

Leave the tedious, everyday tasks that take away from crafting and executing tactical strategies to your faction as you explore the galaxy
Discover different planet types: some rich in resources, some barren and unfit for terraforming
Expand your empire by choosing which planets to invade, colonize, destroy or simply ignore
As you conquer planets, acquire resources to grow and strengthen your fleet, empowering you to overthrow enemy factions and rule the galaxy.

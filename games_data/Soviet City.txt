Soviet City is a game made up of quick game plays, where building and control is essential
We take a lot from classic city builders
The player takes the role of mayor of the city
Soviet law and economy have their own laws
Every building influences a terror bar
Be careful, because excessive terror level leads to a rebellion
On the other hand, when terror level is too low, the dictator can replace you with a more appropriate person
Limited materials and people disobedience can cause trouble with implementation of five-year plans.

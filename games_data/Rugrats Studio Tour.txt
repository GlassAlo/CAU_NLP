Enter the Dressing Room to determine which set you'll start from, then choose the order you want to play the levels
There are 16 scenarios in all, including Pirate Mini-Golf, Buried Treasure, Western Roundup, and Loonie Lander
Once you complete all of the regular stages, you'll enter the Find Dil stages
Collect coins, cookies, chocolate milk, keys, aliens, beach balls, and more as you trek through difficult circumstances to rescue one of your own
Up to four players can get in on the action in Multiplayer mode, as well
Good luck, babies!

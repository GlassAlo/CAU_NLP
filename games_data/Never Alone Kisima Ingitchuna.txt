Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is an atmospheric puzzle platformer and the first game to be developed in collaboration with the Iñupiat, an Alaska Native people, drawn from a traditional story that has been shared across the generations
Nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game.

It features two characters, and it can be played in single-player mode or play cooperatively with a friend as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater caverns and face enemies both strange and familiar.

You'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds and meet legendary characters from Iñupiaq stories — all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language.

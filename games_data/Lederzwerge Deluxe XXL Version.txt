Originally designed as the heroes of a teaser game for phenomedia's Sven Bomwollen series, these garden gnomes dressed in leather are slightly different
As soon as the leather dwarves feel unobserved, they cut loose in the most shameless manner.
The player's objective is to keep them from performing their pervert actions with the - mouse controlled - whip in order to obtain a lot of points
One must not get diverted by the dwarves' animated poses or their insolent comments
This could mean a loss of points or worse
There are different settings like the garden, the greenhouse or the darkroom.

As a bonus, there are two extra mini games included:

"Dance the leather dwarf" - Make the dwarf dance to cool beats
The better your sense of rhythm, the higher the score.

"Sing Sing! - The dwarves prove their singing talent and you have to repeat the lyrics.

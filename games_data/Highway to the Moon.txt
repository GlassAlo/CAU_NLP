Highway to the Moon is a fast-paced scrolling arcade shooter where you take control of Jacob Helaway, stunt man and thrill-seeker extraordinaire, as he makes his way to the Moon in pursuit of the interstellar criminal known only as the Moon Man
Youâ€™ll have your work cut out for you though, because between the Unger Max Gang, Air Traffic Control, Alien Affairs, and Leadersquad, it looks like everyone wants a piece of the Moon Man.

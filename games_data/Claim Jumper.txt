You and your adversary are in a wild west town at the time of the gold rush
Gold bars wild randomly spawn on the screen
It is your task to collect the bars and bring them to the assay office
The assay office in turn converts gold bars into money which you have to deposit in your bank
Each player has his own bank in town, so it's a matter of who will get the money to his bank first
After having collected ten bundles of dough you earn a house and heaps of bonus points
You can shoot the other cowboy who wil be hospitalized for a few seconds, giving you the opportunity to collect some gold/money in the meantime
The two cowboys are also followed by snakes and tumbleweeds respectively
However, snakes only go after one of the two cowboys while the tumbleweeds follow the other one
After being touched by the snakes/tumbledweeds the cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds
Shooting a snake turns it into a tumbleweed (and vice versa) therefore enabling the player to raise the number of enemies for his opponent.

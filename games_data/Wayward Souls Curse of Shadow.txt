Wayward Souls is an action-adventure game built for quick playthroughs and massive amounts of replay value
It was inspired by Spelunky, Secret of Mana, and our previous game, Mage Gauntlet.

Procedurally generated random levels mean that every time you play the game, it's a different experience
Control one of six characters, all with their own unique playstyles, abilities, and equipment
Explore and fight for survival, in combat where your tactics, positioning, and timing matter.

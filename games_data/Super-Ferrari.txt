Typical racing game
You have to dodge the other cars with your Formula 1 car to become first in that Grand Prix
Its cool though how day and night and the weather changes
It´s from the famous "Quelle" games (Quelle was a big german mail order company that also made video games for the Atari 2600)
Although Super-Ferrari is a rip off of the racing game "Enduro" by Activision it´s fun to play

 
Quelle games are in Europe and especially in Germany highly unpopular amongst collectors
Interesting fact: James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, owns at least one of those games.

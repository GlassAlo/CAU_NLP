While on a routine patrol of one of the five planetoid outposts of the Galactic Federation, you are set upon by angry G-bellians who believe you have kidnapped one of their most prized performers, Paulette the G-belly dancer
Before you are able to explain your innocence, the G-bellians attack and you are forced to defend your planetoid
Using radar and plasma weapons you destroy first the ships and then the G-bellians themselves before you run out of fuel
As you make a run for fuel, some of the G-bellians follow you into the time warp
But before you can get to your fuel you have to destroy the oncoming G-bellians
Finally you reach the fuel dump and lock into the center of the fuel target..
then onto the next planetoid...

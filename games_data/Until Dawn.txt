Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game
It was originally planned as a first-person game for the PlayStation 3's motion controller PlayStation Move, but the motion controls were later dropped when it became a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.

Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough
Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the "Butterfly Effect" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on
For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room
Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another
The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings
Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made
The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game
In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has "hundreds of endings"
Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.

The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions
There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood
In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design
Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.

The aim of the game is for you to collect as much gold as possible, and get 
it and the gem back to the tent You will only score points for these items 
when they are actually dropped in the tent NOTE that the game ends when you 
drop the gem in the tent, so if you want to acquire the maximum score you 
should leave this until the end 
 
At the start of the game you are at the entrance to the mines You will find 
the tent to the right, your Landrover to the left, and a number of oxygen 
bottles, batteries and spades scattered at your feet You will already be 
holding and using 1 oxygen bottle and 1 battery displayed on the right of the 
screen; and m addition to these you will be carrying 1 spare oxygen bottle
1 
spare battery and 1 spade which are displayed at the bottom of the screen 
 
You may choose to carry 4 items with you at a time To pick up another item 
move your man above and slightly to the left of the item you wish to select 
and then press the SPACE-BAR to enter selection mode You should then move the 
Right or Left keys or joystick position so that the red bar at the bottom of 
your screen moves to an empty position Press T or the Fire-button to take the 
obiect 
 
If you press SPACE-BAR by mistake and do not want to pick anything up
just 
press the Up key or move the joystick up to exit the selection mode To drop an 
object move your man to a clear piece of ground, press the SPACE-BAR
then 
move the red bar under the item you wish to drop and press T or the 
Fire-button To swop an object that you are carrying for one on the ground, 
first move above the object, press SPACE-BAR
then move the red bar under the 
item you wish to swop and press T or the Fire-button 
 
A number of obstacles await you in the caves Some of these, like the green 
slime, the spiders that come down on a thread, and the dragon's flames, are 
instantly fatal Others, like the bats, the scorpions, and the spiders that 
scurry along the corridors may be killed if you are carrying a spade when you 
run into them
Note that when you are climbing the ladders you cannot also use 
your spade and so may be killed To prevent this you should stop your man 
climbing and face sideways while you are fightmg-off the attack Some of the 
tunnels are flooded, and you can only pass through these while you still have 
some oxygen in your tank (displayed on the right of the screen)

 
Your air supply goes down steadily while you are in the water If you run out 
of oxygen when you are submerged you drown Similarly the battery of your pit 
lamp will slowly be discharging all the time you are m the caves Your lamp 
will fade as soon as your batteries have run out
in which case you will die 
As soon as either a battery or an oxygen cylinder on the right of your screen 
is empty it is automatically replaced by a spare one from your load, providing 
you have one left Note that when your TIME' is up lie: when you have been 
playing for 9999 time units) the game ends, so don't hang around just killing 
the monsters, as this won't give you a very high score 
 
TREASURE 
 
There are 20 gold bars which are coloured yellow, and scattered throughout 
the mine workings There is only one gem which is hidden deep m the mines 
beyond the last of the dragons Getting it back to your tent is your ultimate 
aim If you are killed while carrying the diamond it will be returned to its 
original position m the caves Just carry these up to the tent and they will 
automatically be taken from your load and added to your score 
 
LIVES 
 
You get five lives per game Each time one of your lives is lost you will be 
shown how many are left, and then be returned to your last position, with all 
the objects that you were carrying at the time

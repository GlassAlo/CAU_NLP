Woozworld is a social MMO based on fashion, fame, and talking to others
You can sell, buy and trade clothes, level up by doing quests, and customize your own rooms, called "Unitz", with furniture, wallpapers, and sky textures.

Sometimes there are also events where you get to meet the creators or the "celebrities" of Woozworld such as Mya or Jay Wooz.

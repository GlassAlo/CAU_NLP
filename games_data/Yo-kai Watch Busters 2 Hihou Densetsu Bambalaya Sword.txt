In Yo-kai Watch Busters 2: Hihou Densetsu Bambalaya Sword, players are led to Karakuri Island by the great adventurer Indy J, where it is said that the treasure of a pirate king rests
The “Brandory Family,” strong rivals and heinous thieves who have served a total of 10,000 years in prison, are also after the treasure.

New treasure yo-kai such as Narcis 2-Sei, Ancordead, Madomoaizel, Zapdokia, Doescalibur, and Rosetta Stone will appear
By using new weapons called “Treasure Gear,” which come in forms such as the “Magnum” gun, “Tune Sword,” and “Sniper” gun, you can make your way to the treasure with greater advantage
There are also item boxes that can’t be destroyed unless a Treasure Gear is used
Four-player multiplayer is also supported.

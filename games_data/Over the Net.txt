The game simulates the normal rules of beach volleyball two against two, with adjustable set number and the optional option to assign point even on ball change
You can face a single match or the Sea Cup, a series of rounds in five world camps (Rimini, Fiji, Seychelles, Ibiza, Miami).

Each player always controls the same volleyball player during a match; each of the four volleyball players can be controlled by a human player or by the computer, and in the case of two human players these can cooperate in the same team or be opponents
In the Amiga version, as in the previous World Cup 90 of the same manufacturers, it is also supported the hardware accessory that allows you to connect up to 4 joysticks, allowing three or four human players to participate simultaneously.

In beating you can choose whether or not to use the jump; the other reception, dribble and dunk moves are automatically chosen based on the situation and the player only needs to position himself and press the fire button
In defense you can make the wall
Trajectory and force of the shots are influenced by the precision in the synchrony of the shot
The shadow perpendicular to the ground helps to understand the position of the ball

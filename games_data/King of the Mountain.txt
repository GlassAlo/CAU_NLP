Head up the mountain, avoiding bears, boulders and inclement weather
But first, stock up on supplies -- you won't get far without food and shelter
But don't overpack -- the extra weight will slow you down

 
Reach the top of the mountain by managing the quantity of Fire, Food, Water, Ammunition, Shelter, Raft you carry
Watch for weather conditions and do not exhaust the $300 you are given when purchasing your goods
As you climb the mountain, your health is shown by the color of your climber
Red is full health, Blue is Medium health and Yellow is low health.

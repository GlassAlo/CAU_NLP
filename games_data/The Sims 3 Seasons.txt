All-new activities, like soccer, big seasonal festivals, and celebrations, bring the spirit of each season to life in The Sims 3: Seasons
Let your Sims swim in the ocean on a hot summer day, bob for apples in the autumn leaves, test their snowboarding skill on the half pipe, or welcome spring showers with a walk in the rain and a colorful umbrella
Your Sims can pucker up at the kissing booth at the spring festival, or see what Halloween surprises await in the haunted house
With new foods, d√©cor, and weather effects, your Sims can enjoy the bounty and beauty of the ever-changing seasons and play with life like never before!

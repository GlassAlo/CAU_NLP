Six months have passed since Takaya moved to this town..
One day, he accidentally strikes a living creature
It is "Ring" and he says he is a messenger of the God who protects this area
And Takaya is forced to go through a trial to take over the God
The trial is to get a girlfriend during a certain period
He doesn't want to be the God, and he ignores it and goes to school...

Tomb Raider: The Lost Artifact is a mini-sequel to Tomb Raider III, released exclusively for PC and macOS
Unlike the expansion packs for the first two games, this was initially sold as a standalone product rather than as part of a re-release, and was not available for free download for existing owners.

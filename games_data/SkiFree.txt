SkiFree is a casual single-player sports simulator wherein the player uses the keyboard or the mouse to control a skier across a white background representing snow on a mountainside
The object of the game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles (trees, stumps, dogs, etc.) The player can also opt to partake in three modes: slalom, freestyle, and tree slalom
In slalom, players must properly ski around flags in an attempt to complete the run with the shortest time possible
Tree slalom adds obstacles to the slalom run
In freestyle, players ski downhill and jump off ramps while racking up points by performing tricks
Deductions are imposed for colliding into obstacles or failing to land properly after a stunt
When the player passes the 2,000-meter mark, the Abominable Snowman appears and starts to chase the player, eating them if it catches them.

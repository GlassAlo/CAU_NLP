Enter the realm of a retired assassin, forced back into action by treason
You may be a hired killer but you still have a sense of loyalty and justice
Visit the dark recesses of a world corrupted by crime, greed, degradation and dishonor
And a past that catches up with you.

Trust no one - if the price is right, the finger of your most trusted ally will be on the trigger
Your targets may hide in the most remote areas of the planet, but their destruction is never prevented - only postponed.

Learn your trade - master your tools - overcome your obstacles - outsmart your enemies - eliminate your targets
Remember: rash decisions bleed consequences
Know when to strike instantly, know when to take your time
Chance favors the prepared
Failure is not an option.

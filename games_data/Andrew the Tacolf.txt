Andrew The Tacolf is a game that took me 1 week to program
It's a platformer which gameplay resembles games like "Cat Mario", or "Meatboy" I made this game in Game Maker 8.1 please play it, it's awesome and I bet you'll like it! :3
Gameplay (includes the game link, which is..
of course free).
Also, there's no music
Only sound effects

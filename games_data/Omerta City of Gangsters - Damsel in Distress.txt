Henry McCarty had the unremarkable childhood of a typical Texas farm boy
Henry was a hot-shot and a rascal and not so much fond of his father
When the old man lost the McCarty ranch to the bank, the young Henry finally rebelled and took off to seek his own fate.

In the next ten years Henry changed a handful of jobs
By the start of the War McCarty already had problems with local criminals and decided to abandon the state of Texas
Packing his arrogant temper, his disdainful attitude towards the spoilt city-boys and a pair of trusty revolvers, he headed to New York City.

This new scenario which plays out in the new Suburbs district starts when Lucky Luciano wants Henry “The Kid” McCarty to join his cause
Things start to go haywire when we find out that “The Kid” is already on a mission for a damsel in distress.

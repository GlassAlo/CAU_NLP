Abstractism - is an absolutely trivial platformer, but with the one really special feature - there is no the "Game Over"! But instead, there is an ASMR soundtrack, a stylish minimalistic design and a relaxing atmosphere inside!

Abstractism was delisted on Steam on July 30th, 2018 after players like YouTuber SidAlpha began investigating the gameâ€™s high CPU and GPU usage
Investigators discovered the game was running cryptocurrency mining software and the developers encouraged players to leave the game running in the background to accrue in-game items.

At the same time, the developers were engaging in the practice of releasing Steam Marketplace items that very closely mimicked sought after items from other popular titles
By offering these items to unsuspecting players on Steam, they would sell the item and then alter the appearance and description.

In response, Valve pulled the game from the Steam store on July 30th and banned the developer from the service
At the time they also instituted a system of confirmation messages that players needed to click in order to confirm item trade offers for games that Steam has identified they have never played.

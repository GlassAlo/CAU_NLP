This is a sequel to the first Farland Story game, released in early 1994
The game looks very similarly to its predecessor
The entire gameplay is dedicated to strategic battles, during which you navigate your large party in turn-based mode over the world map
Once you have issued commands to all your party members, it's the enemies' turn to act
You can attack enemies when they are in range of your weapon, or cast healing and offensive area spells
Your characters level up, can use items, and equip a variety of weapons and armor pieces.

It is the future and motorcycle cops now use air bikes to patrol the streets and catch criminals
You are one cop, and over various missions you are to chase after various criminals and catch them within a time limit
Once all the criminals are caught, you then have to smash into the gang leader within a new time limit, decreasing his energy bar until it is empty
The gameplay of this title is similar to Chase H.Q.
Be careful, as the leader has a weapon and when hit slows you down.

A Japanese RPG loosely adapted from the 1985 Activision PC game Hacker
The player character uses a robotic fighter to hunt for clues behind a global conspiracy.

Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC/Amiga/Atari ST strategy game Hacker
As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game
Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot.

The player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim
In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.

Dr
Hello is an unlicensed Dr
Mario clone developed for the MSX and ported to the Sega Master System
It was developed in South Korea by a company known as "Sis Co." in 1991, without the backing from either Sega or Nintendo
The game uses a completely different set of graphics and music to Dr
Mario, but the gameplay is exactly the same

 
Despite being released on a Master System cartridge, the Master System version runs in SG-1000 mode, and hence appears to have weaker graphics than most other Master System games
This is likely because the MSX and SG-1000 share similar specifications, and porting from one system to another was not too difficult.

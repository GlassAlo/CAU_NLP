Released in 2008 by Sugar Games and GameTop.

Rainbow Web II is a matching game where three or more same-color gems have to be aligned in a spider web, horizontally or vertically, to make them disappear
Some of the jewels have letters, and the main goal of each level is to spell a phrase at the top-left of the screen by matching these gems.

Black pearls can only be removed when they reach the web edge or center
There are two mini-games that appear between levels: a hunt for hidden pieces of an object in a scenery, and a sliding-tile puzzle.

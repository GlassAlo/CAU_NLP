Imakuni? no Ball is a port of the Game & Watch title 'Ball' with Imakuni?, an infamously goofy and eccentric Creatures Inc
staffer, as the starring role
This game is notable for being one of two scannable extras supplied on the Shining Imakuni? promotional card, the other being a biography on Imakuni? and various fun facts about him
The card is scannable via the Japanese e-Reader+ peripheral for the GameBoy Advance
It was given out with member registrations to the Pok√©mon Fan Club starting January of 2002 alongside a commemorative sleeve.

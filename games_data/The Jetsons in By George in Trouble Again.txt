The Jetsons in By George, in Trouble Again: Help George Save The Spacely Sprocket Plant

The Jetsons by Softie is a decent platformer starring Mr
Spacely, George, Elroy, Astro and Rosie, main characters from Hanna Barbara's charming TV cartoon about an accident-prone space-age family
The plot: renegade robots have taken one of Mr
Spacely's sprocket plants
And George, his most stupid subordinate, may just be stupid enough to risk his life to get it back
You can choose to play as either George or Elroy in one-player mode, or play both characters with a friend in two-player hotseat mode
The gameplay is simple: use the arrow keys to avoid hostile robots; run, crawl, and jump your way to the next screen
You have three lives (called "days" in the game); losing all of them means restarting that level
There is also a strict time limit on each level in the form of energy counter: you will die when the countdown reaches zero
Fortunately, the game is neither difficult nor long enough to be frustrating, although the characters' movements are somewhat too "sticky," i.e
unresponsive to keystrokes.

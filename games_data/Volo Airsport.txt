Volo Airsport is for those who fly like birds whenever they close their eyes
Take to the skies and fly past mountains in a wingsuit
Try to hug the cliffs at over 250 km/h or cruise at high altitudes and admire the scenery
Your body and gear are fully physically simulated
You fly by controlling your character's muscles directly, which changes your pose, which interacts with the air around you
You can see, hear, and feel every gust of wind as you pass it.

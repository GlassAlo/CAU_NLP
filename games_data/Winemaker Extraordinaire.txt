Along the same lines of globetrotting "tycoon" games like Chocolatier and Tradewinds, Winemaker Extraordinaire is a business sim in which players assume the role of Maria Bellaventura, a woman trying to turn her late grandfather's winemaking operation into a worldwide sensation
Gamers travel to 15 beautiful locations around the world, discovering 20 unique wine blends and running errands for members of the Guild of Extraordinary Winemakers
There are time-management, match-three, and block-dropping mini-games that help determine the quality of the wine, and if players help each of the 15 Guild members, they can unlock the formula for the world's most spectacular wine, known as "Vino Ultimae."

A time-management game based on the TV show of the same name, Top Chef puts you into the shoes of a new contestant on the show
The game is divided into 15 episodes, with each episode consisting of two Quickfire challenges and one Elimination challenge.

Within the Quickfire events, you will be asked to create a dish based on certain constraints
For example, you might be asked to create a salad based on the color white
That meal is divided into steps; for each step, you will need to pick ingredients, then process them
You have a wide variety of ingredients to choose from, and some go together better than others
If you pick interesting combinations of ingredients, the judges will comment, and you will get a better score
Also, you will receive a chaining bonuses for finishing up with multiple ingredients at around the same time
Once all steps are done, you will be graded on adhering to the instructions, the quality of the food, style, and time taken.

Elimination challenges are similar, but require you to make an entire meal instead of just one dish.

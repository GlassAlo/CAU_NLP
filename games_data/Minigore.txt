Players control the main character, John Gore, in a world called "Hardland." Gameplay revolves around Gore shooting creatures called "furries", who are trying to kill him
A cloverleaf will generate randomly after a certain number of furry kills
Collecting three clovers will turn Gore into a minotaur, granting him invincibility and allowing him to stomp on enemies
This lasts for about 15â€“20 seconds
The player has three lives and accumulates points for each furry killed
There are also OpenFeint and Game Center leaderboards and achievements.

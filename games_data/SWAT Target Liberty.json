In SWAT: Target Liberty, you will lead a team of highly trained officers on missions to safely rescue hostages while subduing and eliminating enemies utilizing authentic SWAT combat tactics, close-quarters combat, and less than lethal weapons; all the while uncovering a plot that threatens to drive the U.S
to the brink of a world wide nuclear conflict

 
Tactical/squad-based gameplay, randomized AI placement, team development and multiplayer maps create an authentic and realistic SWAT experience.

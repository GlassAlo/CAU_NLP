Elminage: Gothic is a first-person dungeon-crawler modeled after the mechanics of classic titles in the genre, such as the early Wizardry games, with the THAC0 battle system
Gothic is the fourth game in the Elminage series
It is set in a world where Great gods clash with Dark gods for power through the faith of humans
You form a party of up to six characters, with sixteen classes available such as Hunter, Thief, Summoner and Valkyrie, and take them out into dungeons to fight monsters and gather loot
Most dungeons will have some quests you can do inside them
There are 400 types monsters to fight and lots of skills/spells to learn
Over 600 different types of items can be found
The game has a punishing difficulty
In some cases enemies can kill a character in one hit without being able to fight back
As such a grind-heavy approach is encouraged.

The PC conversion is identical to the original game, but has higher resolution art and an improved user interface
The original PSP game was also only available in Japanese.

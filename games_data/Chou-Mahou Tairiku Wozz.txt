A traditional Japanese-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire: turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective
You control all three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her perspective
In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the one you chose.

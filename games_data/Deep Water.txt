Deep Water is a single player action shooter game set in a post-apocalyptic world where the atmosphere has changed after an unspecified disaster
You now take on the role of a young man named El Shipak who hunts sea monster for a living
Six months ago Shipak has sighted a special monster and he is now obsessed with hunting it down.

Gameplay includes sailing around the oceans with El Shipaks boat
In the Oceans are floating harbors where supplies like fuel and ammo can be bought to hunt down the monster
Here the player can also buy better guns and upgrade his ship
At the harbor the player can also take on missions
Missions usually involve sailing to a certain area and gunning down enemies from the deck of your ship
Maneuvering the ship and fighting off the enemies canâ€™t be done at the same time
If fighting enemies the player can move freely across the deck of the ship.

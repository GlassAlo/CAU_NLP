Deepak Fights Robots is an arcade platformer.

It features over 180 levels, and provides a different subset of these levels to the player every new game
It contains a lot of secret content
It may or may not contain dozens of references to hip-hop songs that will fly right over your head
It may or may not contain a secret robot boss with the face of William Howard Taft
It absolutely does contain funk, flavor, and good old fashioned, honest-to-goodness, thank-you-for-not-wasting-my-time FUN.

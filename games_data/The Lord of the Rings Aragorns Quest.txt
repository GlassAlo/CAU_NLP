The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest for the PS3 and Wii tells the story of Aragorn during the War of the Ring
Samwise Gamgee is narrating, and recalls the story to entertain his children who want to hear about the adventures of Aragorn
The game differs in several ways from the PS2 and handheld versions - the biggest being the behind view perspective, as opposed to the birds eye of the PS2 version, and the 'between the main story sections' gameplay in the Shire.

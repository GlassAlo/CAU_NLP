Join Jo on the world's weirdest summer vacation
Jo is into Kendo, Japanese fencing, so her parents sent her to Japan to study under Osaki sensei
Osaki is the greatest sword master of all time, but he looks like a green haired cyberpunk
Just to crank up the strangeness Osaki gives you a talisman that transforms you into a seventies super hero
You've never seen action this crazy or fun
Kendo Rage is the rage.

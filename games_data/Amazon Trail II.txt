Amazon Trail II is an educational game and the sequel to The Amazon Trail
In this game you have to canoe up the Amazon River
Before starting, it is obligatory to choose yourself a guide - each of the four available candidates has a special skill that may help you on your journey
In the course of the game, you need to manage the supplies; meet, talk, and trade with different people presented by live actors in FMV; read maps; and decide how much to eat, when to rest, and how fast to paddle.

The game also contains a huge amount of information about the science and history of the Amazon rainforest
It is possible to explore the rainforest along the route spotting one of 100 different species and taking pictures or picking up fruits for the supply

# üß† Boolean Information Retrieval Evaluation Report

## üìò Introduction

This report presents an evaluation of a Boolean Information Retrieval (IR) system using a dataset of game-related documents. A set of Boolean queries was executed against a pre-built inverted index, and the system‚Äôs effectiveness was measured using **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.

---

## üîç Evaluation Method

Each query was evaluated by:

- Retrieving documents using Boolean logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
- Comparing results against a predefined set of relevant documents
- Calculating:
  - **Precision** = Relevant ‚à© Retrieved / Retrieved
  - **Recall** = Relevant ‚à© Retrieved / Relevant
  - **F1 Score** = Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

## üÜö Boolean vs Vectorial Model

| Feature                  | Boolean IR                 | Vectorial IR (TF-IDF + Cosine)     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Query flexibility        | Low ‚Äì exact matching       | High ‚Äì partial matching allowed     |
| Result ranking           | No ranking (binary)        | Ranked by similarity                |
| User effort              | High ‚Äì requires precise logic | Lower ‚Äì more forgiving queries   |
| Performance              | Fast and efficient         | Slightly slower but more nuanced    |
| Relevance detection      | All-or-nothing             | Measures degrees of relevance       |
| Term weighting           | No                         | Yes (TF-IDF)                        |
| Best use cases           | Filtering, exact queries   | Search engines, semantic retrieval  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Improving the Boolean IR System

To improve the Boolean model's real-world applicability:

- **Stemming / Lemmatization** to match variations of the same word.
- **Stopword removal** to reduce noise.
- **Query expansion** to include synonyms and related terms.
- **Proximity operators** (`NEAR`, `WITHIN`) to allow for context-aware queries.
- **Phrase support** (`"elder scrolls"`) for exact multi-word matching.
- **Partial match fallback** using ranking techniques when Boolean yields no results.

---

## üîó Combining Boolean and Vectorial Models

To enhance retrieval quality and flexibility, a **hybrid system** can be used:

- Step 1: Use Boolean logic to **filter** documents logically.
- Step 2: Apply **vector space ranking** to sort them by relevance.
- Result: High efficiency and strong relevance, especially for ambiguous or large queries.

This approach allows users to define hard constraints (Boolean) while still benefiting from ranked, flexible outputs (Vectorial).

---

## üó£Ô∏è Final Discussion

The Boolean model performs excellently for exact, rule-based queries ‚Äî as seen in the high precision and recall scores. However, it lacks ranking, fuzziness, and semantic depth.

Combining Boolean logic with vectorial relevance scores would allows users to benefit from both **control** and **flexibility**, producing smarter and more user-friendly search results.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Boolean IR is simple, interpretable, and fast. While it's limited in flexibility, it forms a critical foundation. Enhancing it with ranking and semantic tools creates a powerful hybrid IR system.
